### Requirements
Made with the recent version of bun and vite
```sh
bun version >=1.3.3 
```

### Usage
just run bun install and let the tool do his thing. to test the core just run:

```sh
bun dev:
```

### Why?
Because i wanted to practice typescript and needed something to animate in three.js without writing code.
React wrapper is on the way.

### Modularity
The project is thought to be modular in any way, ui included.
My knowledge in ui design is poor so don’t expect a something revolutionary.
